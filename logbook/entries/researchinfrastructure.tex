This chapter is intended to introduce everyone to technology or tools that are integral to our workflow.
It describes our research infrastructure in terms of three types of issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Code}: organize it, write it, run it, track it
\item \textbf{Collaboration}: assigning tasks, sharing code, reviewing code, reporting results
\item \textbf{Computing}: geeky details
\end{itemize}

We organize the project as a series of tasks, so our organization of code and data takes a task-based perspective.
After writing code, we automate its execution via \texttt{make}.
We track our code (and the rest of the project) using \texttt{Git}, a version control system.
Collaboration occurs via Asana task assignments, BitBucket code reviews, and logbook entries that share research designs and results.

Use a good text editor like \href{https://www.sublimetext.com/}{SublimeText} or \href{https://atom.io/}{Atom} to write code, slides, and papers.
\href{http://plain-text.co/write-and-edit.html}{Word processors aren't text editors}.
Your text editor should, at minimum, offer you
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting}{syntax highlighting},
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion}{tab autocomplete},
and \href{https://www.sublimetext.com/}{multiple selection}.

Our approach assumes that you'll use Unix/Linx/MacOSX.
Plain-text social science lives at the *nix command line.
\href{https://github.com/gslab-econ/ra-manual/wiki/Getting-Started}{Gentzkow and Shapiro}: ``The command line is our means of implementing tools.''
Here are two intros to the Linux shell:

	\item \url{http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/}
\end{itemize}
Getting started at the command line can be a little overwhelming, but it's well worth it.
While you can use GUI apps to interact with most of our workflow (e.g., SourceTree for version control),
automation of some key parts relies on shell scripts.
See logbook entry \ref{entry:unixshelltips} for an assorted collection of tips.
