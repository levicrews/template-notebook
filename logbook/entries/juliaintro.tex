Jonathan prefers Julia to Matlab.
Jonathan learned Julia by starting with the \href{https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/index_learning_julia.html}{QuantEcon introduction to Julia}.

Here are some helpful resources:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \url{https://julialang.org/}: for installation and general info about julia: blogs, publications, conference
\item \url{https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/introduction/}: excellent manual for julia
\item \url{https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/}: also an excellent manual for Julia with a macro vibe
\item \url{https://github.com/bkamins/Julia-DataFrames-Tutorial}: excellent tutorial on how to read/use DataFrames in Julia
\item \url{https://www.juliabloggers.com/}: to keep up with advancements in Julia
\item \url{http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/}: for interesting discussions about performance in Julia 
\end{enumerate}

List of very useful packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl}: DataFrames in Julia
\item \url{https://github.com/davidanthoff/ReadStat.jl}: read dta files in Julia
\item \url{https://github.com/JuliaIO/JLD.jl}: fantastic way of storing output in Julia
\item \url{https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl}: General optimization in julia
\item \url{https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Calculus.jl}: for automatic diffentiation in Julia (very practical to check your analytical expressions of gradients and hessians)
\end{itemize}

Notes on using Julia on UChicago's Midway computing cluster:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You cannot connect to the external internet from Midway's compute nodes. 
	Julia's packages are pulled from Github, so you must install packages in Julia (and in Stata) when running on a login node.
	\item You can \texttt{Pkg.activate(".")} on a compute node, but you cannot \texttt{Pkg.instantiate()} on a compute node. You need to install packages, define the \texttt{Project.toml}, \texttt{Pkg.instantiate()} and precompile (\texttt{using} commands once) on a login node before moving to the compute nodes.  
\end{itemize}
